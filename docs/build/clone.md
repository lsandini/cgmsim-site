# Downloading the simulator 

## Cloning the repository

Log into your Ubuntu terminal, and then run this command :

```
git clone https://github.com/lsandini/cgmsim.git
```

That's it. A folder called cgmsim has been made for you and all the needed files are in there.

If you'd like to run more simulators on the same machine, just run:

```
git clone https://github.com/lsandini/cgmsim.git cgmsim2
```
... and a separate folder called "cgmsim2" is made, identical to "cgmsim" 
 

## Installing dependencies 

Enter the installation directory of your choice with the cd command (cd = change directory): 

```
cd cgmsim
``` 
or 
```
cd cgmsim2
```
... or whatever your named your install folder.

In your linux terminal, type: 
```
sudo bash install_dependencies.sh
```

Your password will be required. You might see warnings during the installation and it might take a little while. Disregard the warnings and just wait for the process to complete.
