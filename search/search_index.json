Rather than blood glucose (BG) values, it displays a continuous glucose sensor (CGM) trace using Nightscout as visualization tool. Since even the most accurate physiological simulators can at best provide only an approximation of what happens in a living organism, the goal of this simulation is not even to try to match reality, but to provide a framework for practising, learning and/or teaching. The treatment goal in type 1 diabetes is to keep the BG or CGM curve values as close as possible to that of a healthy person. In realistic terms, it means 3.9 \u2013 10 mmol/l or 70-180 mg/dl for CGM curves. The Time In Range (TIR) should be at least 70%. Important Please understand that this simulation: cannot predict individual response to treatment cannot replace traditional patient/caregiver education does not depict 100% realistically human physiology This is work in progress, and all feedback is welcome ! Human physiology \u2301 To understand the mechanics of the simulation, a few things must be considered. After a meal, the absorption of carbohydrates from the gut will also increase the blood glucose. Since insulin replacement is administered subcutaneously and not directly into the hepatic portal vein, some of the ingested food will be absorbed into the main bloodstream directly, bypassing the liver. After a short delay, the CGM will reflect the increase of blood glucose. The endogenous glucose production (EGP) is mainly du to the liver release of glucose into the bloodstream. Either releasing stores (glycogenolysis) or synthesizing new glucose (neoglucogenesis). Various biological states, alcohol and hormones can affect EGP. As glucose is released into the blood stream, the blood glucose concentration increases. Physical exercise affects blood glucose in many ways. Short bouts of intense physical activity will trigger the release of adrenalin, which in turn increases the EGP. In turn, the increased peripheral uptake of glucose in the muscle tissue will lower the blood glucose as physical activity continues. The same continues also during the post exercise phase, until the muscle glycogen stores are repleted. Mealtime insulins have a short duration of activity (DIA, ~3 hours), while long-acting insulin analogs are meant to be injected once or twice a day. Both will lower blood glucose and thus sensor glucose values. The intricate biological pathways affecting the blood glucose variations are difficult to replicate mathematically. The absorption of ingested food from the gut, the absorption of insulin from the subcutaneous tissue, the timing of exercise, the circadian rhythm, menstrual cycle, the moon phase and the alignment of planets all seem to play a role. Adding a touch of random variation (or chaos) brings some realism in the simulation. Why use a simulator ? \u2301 Many scenario-based simulators have been written in the past, like AIDA or the UVA/Padova T1DMS . In contrast, CGMSIM runs in real time like a \"serious game\". It requires time and dedication to reach its goal. It's not a matter of hours or days, but rather weeks or months. Many instances of the simulator can run on one computer, serving many users at a time, making team training possible. Healthcare Professionals - HCPs Unless you or your family member has T1D, it is hard to figure how treatment can be time-consuming, technically difficult or frustrating. Even without having to worry about the risk of long-term vascular complications or acute life-threatening hypoglycemia, early adopters of this simulator showed signs of treatment fatigue after a few weeks already. Living with incertainty 24/7, and facing reports of treatment \"success\" will teach some humility and empathy. Not all patients are equal... Every simulated patient can be defined in terms of weight, insulin sensitivity, amplitude of EGP variability. This website will describe step by step how to install and kickstart the simulation as an administrator, and how to use it as an end-user.

The Carb Ratio (CR) represents the amount of insulin needed to counteract a defined amount of carbs. It is expressed as g/U. For example if 10g of carbs are counteracted by 1 unit of mealtime insulin, the CR is 10 g/U. The Carb (sensitivity) Factor (CF) represents the impact of a defined amount of absorbed carbs on the blood glucose concentration. It can be expressed on mmol/l/g.
