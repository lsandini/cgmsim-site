## Nightscout

In order to use this simulator, you'll need an instance of Nightscout (NS). If you are not familiar yet with NS, go over to [Nightscout's installation guide for new users](https://nightscout.github.io/nightscout/new_user).

Make sure to follow all the steps and perform this installation first. It will take you some time, probably about 60 minutes. Write down the URL of your Nightscout website and the password or APISECRET (for example "MYAPISECRET1").

Running Nightscout on Heroku on "free dynos" is free of charge. However, if the amount of work done on the server exceeds a certain limit, your "free dynos" will be exhausted and your site will stop working until the following month. Upgrading your account to "hobby dynos" (7 USD or 6 EUR / month) means your site will run without interruptions.
