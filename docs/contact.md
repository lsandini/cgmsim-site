# Contact me !

There a few good reasons to contact me:

!!! warning "Development ideas"
    Integrating physical activity data from Apple Watch, Android Wear and other activity sensors into the model.

    Offering CGMSIM as a service, so anyone could link a simulated patient to their own Nightscout page.

    Developing CGMSIM as a standalone Android or iOS app  :wink:

Found a bug? Squish it ! I still qualify as a noob, and I am sure you can rewrite all this in clean javascript if you're a pro.

If you have suggestions or would like to contribute, feel free to contact me by email **<lsandini@gmail.com>**.

Thank you !

!!! danger "Coffee ... ?"
    This project was not funded in any way and was written completely in my free time. It required quite some coffee, testing the code on virtual machines and various Raspberry Pi's. 
    
    During the initial testing phase, 10 Nightscout websites on hobby dynos were run simultaneously for my courageous medical students, colleagues and nurses who tested the simulation.

If you want to donate to the project or pay me a coffee
