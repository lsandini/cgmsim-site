In place of showing blood gluce values as one would measure with a finger-prick blood sugar measuring device (or \"glucometer\"), it displays a continuous glucose sensor (CGM) trace using Nightscout (NS) as visualization tool. Since even the most accurate physiological simulators can at best provide only an approximation of what happens in a biological organism, the goal of this simulation is not even to try to match reality, but to provide a practising, learning and/or teaching tool. The treatment goal is keeping the CGM curve values as much of possible in the range, which is 3.9 \u2013 10 mmol/l or 70-180 mg/dl. The target Time In Range (TIR) is at least 70%. Physiology \u2301 To understand the mechanics of such a simulation, just a few things must be considered. a) The liver releases glucose into the bloodstream by either releasing its stores (glycogenolysis) or synthesizing new glucose from amino acids (neoglucogenesis). The kidneys are also able to produce glucose in small amount. This is called the endogenous glucose production (EGP). Various biological states and hormones can affect this (not only alcohol!). As glucose is released into the blood stream, the blood glucose concentration increases. b) The ingestion of food and the digestion and absorption of carbohydrates will also increase the blood glucose. Since insulin replacement is administered subcutaneously and not into the hepatic portal vein, some of the ingested food will be absorbed into the main bloodstream directly. After a short delay, the CGM will reflect the increase of blood glucose. c) Physical exercise affects blood glucose in many ways. Intensive bouts of physical activity will trigger the release of adrenalin, which releases increases the EGP. In turn, the increased uptake of glucose in the muscle tissue will lower thew blood glucose as physical activity continues, but also during the post exercise phase, until the muscle glycogen stores are repleted. d) Mealtime insulins have a short duration of activity (DIA -around 3 hours), while long-acting insulin analogs are meant to be injected once or twice a day. Both will lower blood glucose and thus sensor glucose values. e) The very intricate biological pathways affecting the blood glucose variations are difficult to replicate mathematically. The absorption of ingested food from the gut, the absorption of insulins from the subcutaneous tissue, the timing of exercise, the circadian rhythm, menstrual cycle and the alignment of the planets in the solra system all play a role. Adding a touch of randomness or chaos brings some realism in the simulation. Important Please understand that this simulation cannot: predict individual response to treatment replace traditional patient/caregiver education This is work in progress, and all feedback is welcome ! Who needs a simulator ??? \u2301 Med Students It's really easy to panic if CGMSIM fails to build or if you are having trouble using your app, but take the time to do a quick search in these docs and in your favorite social media group before posting a question. \"Nurses\" Test test test This is an info box Take it one step at a time...
